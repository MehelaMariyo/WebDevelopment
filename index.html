                        Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Kelaniya, pursuing a degree in
                        Statistics and Computer Science. This field fascinates me as it combines analytical thinking
                        with the power of technology, and I'm passionate about discovering how data can drive innovative solutions.<br><br>
                        In this blog, I aim to share my journey, insights, and experiences as I navigate through my studies
                        and beyond. From academic achievements to personal reflections, I hope my stories resonate with you and
